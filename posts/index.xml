I have tried my level best to recollect the scenes from the dream and put it across. But still, the direction of story may change unexpectedly, scenes may have abrupt cuts and the story may resemble movies that I have watched.

Skydiving was one of the activity that I had decided to do before I leave Dubai. And today I did it.
Me and my collegue Jesvin (who also happens to be my Team lead at office :D) made bookings in Skydive Dubai for the morning slot at 10:45 AM.</description></item></channel></rss>
