#### Warning
This is a work of fiction, or better a work of my subconscious mind. A little bit different from my previous blogs about my dreams, I have reordered certain scenes, which I felt make better sense for the complete story.

Characters:
- Akhil
- [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)

##### Scene 1
I am at the SpaceX rocket building site, looking at how the rockets are built. Multiple rockets are being built, some kept in storage, and quick paced work is pogressing on the site scattered across the site.

While I am standing there admiring the build process, Elon Musk is casually walking over the construction site as he used to do regularly looking and evaluating the progress they are making. He comes to me asking, how am I doing and then we go on to discuss a lot about rockets and the reusability and his plans to colonize mars.


##### Scene 2
I ask him how the idea of reusability came to his mind. He stated, for that you have to go around 20 years back, when NASA was using solid fuel engines for rockets. 
...
Going back to the day , he tells me that there are some undisclosed stories and events that had happened with each
launch that they cant say publicly. He goes on and explains this,

At that time, NASA used a rocket engine called Agena which had the following engine structure. For the engine to start correctly to get max thrust at liftoff, 9 correctly calculated firings have to be done at the laucnh. which means at first the engine centre, and as the fuel reaches next stage, have to trigger another fire and so on  in the spiral structure.

But the problem with this was that, there were no computers that could perform this inside the engine, and the firing has to be done from within the engine. The next part that he described gave me chills. To perform this firing one man was assigned for every launch, who has to trigger the firing from beneath the engine. But the 9th firing event was almost seconds before the engine goes full on that the man who fires never gets the chance to run away before the hot gases and exhaust comes from the engine nozzle. This was like getting hit with pyro technique on your body but with a million times more pwerful. so the person standing there instantly vapourised in the gas, and NASA never told this to anyone. So for every launch from the ground , one man has to be sacrficed. This man was named as an effigy in NASA books.

##### Scene 3
hearing this i was little bit friegthened. elon says that because of this he wanted to invent new rocket engines 
that was reusable and could be started remotely. Then he goes on and ask me about my career, and what I was doing. Told that i was a software engineer. He asked me which are top 10 companies that I like to work for. Told that Tesla was my dream, he mocked me saying since he is the CEO, any one will say it and laughed about it. Then at number 2 , I mentioned Google, then Redhat etc.. The last one I mentioned was Netgear. He seemed a little puzzled. He used a little projector present there. and took us into a 3D simulation of a netgear office. It had multiple cubbicles and people working on there desks. He said if this is the type of company that you like to work for, then you are not worthy for Tesla. My dreams of working for Tesla shattered instantly.


##### Scene 4
We are still walking around the rocket factory and I ask him , how he knew about the agena engines and the effigy that was burnt to death. He tells that he was one such man chosen for a mission. After firing the engines he tried to run away, but he said something happened, may be spirits of previous effigies that died at the launch pad. He could feel someone taking him far away from the launch pad. He suffered 3rd degree burns (I could really feel the pain in my body during the dream) on his body but recovered after many years and went onto start SpaceX.

I was amazed by the story.

##### Scene 5
By then we had reached the main assembly are of the rocket where multiple parts where assembled. I went inside and took some design papers for the rocket that was lying around and ran away. I was a Russian spy sent to steal the designs of Spacex rockets. While I was running away I could smell radioactive sodium on my body and slowly my energy started to decrease, I was slowly collapsing on the ground. My eyes and nose slowly started to bleed and I was lying on the ground, unable to move. . 



NOTE:

Netgear : Dont want to tamper the image of the company.
Agena: I have heard about this in some hollywoood movies.
Radioactive sodium: only heard of it before. Dont know whether it causes radiation poisoning or not.
